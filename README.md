## MCL

MCL, my C language, is a toy script language that looks a lot like C but also includes some modern features like other script languages.

Some of import features that're planned:

* Most C-style grammars
* No pointer
* Simple class/interface
* Strong-typed, static types
* Closure
* GC
* async/await
* Module
* Can be used as a C library
* Can use C/C++ library
* etc.

Let's see what we can get at the end.
